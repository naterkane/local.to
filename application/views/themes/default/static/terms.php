The account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.

This Agreement was created on June 1, 2009 and has not been revised to date. You will be informed of the date of any amendments to this Agreement. All information gathered from Users by this Site will be governed by the Site’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated in this Agreement by reference. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Privacy Policy and this Agreement, the terms of the Privacy Policy prevail over the terms of this Agreement. Please take a minute to read the Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat personally identifiable information. </p>
		
		<h3>Membership Eligibility:</h3>
		
		<p>The Site is intended for people age 13 or over. Our registration process is intentionally designed to identify children under 13 years of age. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use this Site without parental consent. We have also made an effort to specifically limit the Site’s appeal to people of age 13 and older. PIM will not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. You must identify your age during the registration process. PIM takes the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) as well as all FTC regulations very seriously.  We are also strong supporters and maintain strict compliance with the Rules and Regulations set forth thereunder. That being said, we do not assume any responsibility for any misrepresentations regarding your age or parental consent when using this Site. If we determine, however, that you have been falsely using this Site in contradiction to the terms of this Agreement or the membership eligibility requirements section set forth herein, we will terminate your membership and all information associated therewith immediately unless you can verify that you have obtained parental consent to use this Site. </p>
		
		<p>Additionally, some of our services are available only to individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, some of our services are not available to minors. You will be informed of exactly which services require the age of majority (eighteen years or older). If you do not qualify for particular services, you may not use them. We do not assume any responsibility for any misrepresentations regarding your age or parental permission to use this Site and we will not honor any agreements made by any misrepresentations, fraud or falsities. Further, our services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely suspended the Site’s members.  </p>

		<p>From time to time, Users may be asked to confirm their account on the Network via an email message containing a hyperlink to the User’s Network email address.

Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of PIM, which may administers that Network.</p>
		
		<p>Users may delete their own User Content from the Network, so long as they are a Member of that Network. Network Administrators may delete the User Content of one or more Users in their Network. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
		
		<p>Each User may form a group to delineate the audience of certain User Content (“Group”). Each Group may have one or more administrators (the “Group Administrator”). A Group may be designated as open to any User in a Network (a “Public Group”) or a Group may be limited to certain Users in a Network with membership subject to the approval of the Group Administrator (a “Private Group”). A Group Administrator may invite, add or remove Users to that particular Group. Though Users may establish a Private Group, User Content posted within a Private Group on a Network is owned by that Network.</p>

		<p>Users acknowledge and agree that PIM may suspend or terminate their access or use of the Site without prior notice if they engage in conduct that PIM, in its sole discretion, believes violates any term or provision of this Agreement, otherwise violates the rights of PIM or third parties or is otherwise inappropriate for continued access and use of the Site.

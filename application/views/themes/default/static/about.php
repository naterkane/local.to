            It's more about what it lets you do. Local.to lets you view friends and whats happening nearby no matter what<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> geo-location network(s) you prefer to use. Local.to is a service-agnostic platform that makes checking-in to real world locations, the search for something to do, or where to go more efficient.

        <h3>Who is Local.to?</h3>
        <p>
            Local.to was created by Paul Lewis &amp; Nater Kane, two guys who wanted to take the pain out of check-in fatigue. Our passion comes from over two decades of creating user-centric software for the web (between the two of them, of course).

            <li id="note2">As long as you have a mobile device that is GPS/location capable and any of your linked services (or another user's linked services if they've checked-in nearby) has venue data for where you are, we can check you in wherever you go. Our database of available venues is growing bigger and bigger every day.</li>

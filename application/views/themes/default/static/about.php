        <h3>What does Local.to do?</h3>
        <p>
            It doesn't do anything, it's what it lets you do (or saves you from having to do). No matter what<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> geolocation network(s) you prefer to use, Local.to is a service-agnostic platform that makes checking-in to real world locations and the search for something to do, or where to go more efficient.
        </p>
        <h3>How does Local.to work?</h3>
        <p>
            Local.to allows users to search for and check-in to venues all around the world<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> as well as view personalized event information with a (we hope) fast-as-all-heck experience. All users can choose how public, or private they want their activities to be.
        </p>
        <h3>Why use Local.to?</h3>
        <p>
            Local.to is a free service that levels the playing field and gives users of many location-based networking services equal resources to broadcast, communicate, manage, and digest location-based information that's important to them. We created it to help anyone enhance their success navigating the real world.
        </p>
        <h3>Who can use Local.to?</h3>
        <p>
            Right now we're in private beta, but new invitation codes are going out all the time.
        </p>
        <h3>Who is Local.to?</h3>
        <p>
            Local.to was created by Nater Kane and Paul Lewis, two guys who wanted to take the pain out of check-in fatigue. Our passion comes from over two decades of creating user-centric software for the web (between the two of them, of course).

            <li id="note1">We currently only offer check-in support for <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>, <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a>, <a href="brightkite.com">Brightkite</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/latitude/">Google Latitude</a>. More services will be added soon.</li>
            <li id="note2">As long as you have a mobile device that is GPS/location capable and any of your linked services (or another user's linked services if they've checked-in nearby) has venue data for where you are, we can check you in wherever you go. Our database of available venues is growing bigger and bigger every day.</li>

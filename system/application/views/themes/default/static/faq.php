Contact your team admin if you would like them to invite someone to the team or would like them to remove someone. Members include athletes, coaches, and staff.</p>
		<h3>What are the three different streams?</h3>
		<p>There are three types of streams on TeamItUp:</p>

		<p>Updates are real-time messages that are no longer than 140 characters. Updates can be public or private and can be posted on your homepage stream, team page streams, Everyone stream, and user profile streams. Most importantly, they are used to share, communicate, manage, and promote your sports lifestyle on TeamItUp.</p>
		<h3>Who can see the updates?</h3>
		<p>Updates are viewable depending on where a user posts the update and a user's relationship to other members on TeamItUp:</p>
		<h4>I post an update on my homepage</h4>
		<p>If my profile is public, then any users who are following me will see my update in their homepage stream and it will also be displayed in the Everyone stream. If my profile is private, then only users who I have approved to follow me, will see my updates and it will not be displayed in the Everyone stream.</p>
		<h4>I post an update on my team page</h4>
		<p>Any update I post on a team page will only be viewable by members of the same team page. The update will be posted on the team page stream and on the homepage stream of all team members as well. The update will not be displayed on any non-member's homepages and not in the Everyone stream.</p>
		<h3>What are "Private Messages" and how are they used?</h3>
		<p>"Private Messages" are messages that are only exchanged between you and another user you are following or a member on the same team. They are sent to a user's ""private message"" tab, as well as via an email notification, and text message. (if user's settings apply).</p>
